# Giphy: A Simple Gif Generator.

This is a simple practice project, which is a part of the Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript course. The aim of this project is to get the general idea of how APIs work and how they are referenced in JS, synchronous and asynchronous code, and how all these can be put together, showing how they function and what they do in real-time. 

## How does it work?

It is very simple. Users input a search term and the page generates a git related to the search term. For invalid terms, the page throws an error in the console and also displays the likely error in the place of a git.
